:wave: Hello and welcome to **Treasure_Hunter** code repository. A mystery game made using C language, which is playable using CLI. This was our first ever programming project! We did this project as a of our college's course.

## Introduction

This is a mystery game in which you play as an archeologist who goes to an abandoned island in the sea of Atlantis and finds the castle of Anorak to uncover its buried secrets. The game is made using C language and does not need any other hardware requirements other than having a computer. The game has been further enhanced using visuals depicting a conventional cutscene.
